# Plate testers for mechanical switches

Laser cutting plates for your keyboards can be an ordeal.
Cutting plastics always involves various tolerances that can vary from place to place.
That's why I prefer cutting a few testers before committing to a plate order.
Here are the files I use.

All measurements are in mm. unless stated otherwise.
The "recommended spec" hole size for the switch is the middle top on all the testers, the holes vary by 0.05 mm., the order is left to right, then top to bottom.

The top left corner is cut flat, and top right is rounded on all the testers. This marks the orientation definitively.

## Switches

|Switch|Spec hole|Max hole|Min hole|Spec thickness|Recommended thickness|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
[MX](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Cherry_MX)|14x14|14.05x14.05|13.65x13.65|1.5|1.5|
[Omron B3G-S](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Omron_B3G-S_series)*|13.5x13.5|13.55x13.55|13.15x13.15|1.2|1|
[Alps SKCL/SKCM](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series)|15.5x12.8|15.55x12.85|15.15x12.45|1.2|1|
[Hi-Tek 725](https://telcontar.net/KBK/Hi-Tek/Series_725)**|15.62x15.62|15.67x15.67|15.27x15.27|1.4<sup>?</sup>|1.2/1.4|

\*\* - The [specification](https://telcontar.net/KBK/Hi-Tek/docs/Hi-Tek%20Series%20725%20switch%20and%20keycap%20dimensions.pdf) states the switch cutouts are 15.162 mm. squares, but many NMB keyboards also have a small notch on top - some have theorized it's for the clicker mechanism, but I cannot really corroborate that. 
Even clicky switches work fine "in reverse" - with no notch on the clicker. 
The Hi-Tek specifications do not mention plate thickness, but people have measured it to be 1.4 mm. 
From personal experience 1.2 plates also work, but the switches can wobble a little. 
1 mm. is just too loose, and at 1.5 the side latches on the switch cannot grab on. 
Since it's hard to find 1.4 or even 1.2 mm. materials for laser cutting, FR4 might be the better option here.
